decode from Base64:
input: YidkM0JxZGtwQlRYdHFhR3g2YUhsZmF6TnFlVGwzWVROclgyeG9OakJzTURCcGZRPT0nCg==
output: b'd3BqdkpBTXtqaGx6aHlfazNqeTl3YTNrX2xoNjBsMDBpfQ=='
decode once more time from Base64:
input: d3BqdkpBTXtqaGx6aHlfazNqeTl3YTNrX2xoNjBsMDBpfQ==
output: wpjvJAM{zhlzh_yf3jy9wa3k_lh60l00j}

Python code


Explanation:
How do we know this is Base64 code?
the characteristic of Base64:
- The length of a Base64-encoded string is a multiple of 4,
- Only these characters are used: “A” to “Z”, “a” to “z”, “0” to “9”, “+” and “/”,
